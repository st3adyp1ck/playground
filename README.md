# playground

Welcome to the playground!
This is where I dive into the world of JavaScript, exploring coding challenges, experimenting with new concepts, and sharpening my skills one function at a time. Whether it's solving algorithmic puzzles or crafting unique identifiers, this playground is my space to learn, grow, and share my journey as I work toward mastering JavaScript. Feel free to browse through the challenges and see what I've been working on. Each link below will take you to a specific challenge or experiment, showcasing my approach to problem-solving and coding in JavaScript.

All functions and challenges use this page as a running environment, un-comment each function/challenge in its respective JS file.

When I start writing full projects they will be organized into seperate project folders with dedicated environments, for now... this will do.
